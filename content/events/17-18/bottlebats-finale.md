# BottleBats 2.018 Finale

Hello BottleBatsers!

The semester is running at it's end, and so is our competition.
On tuesday 22/05 we're meeting up to decide the winner of the 2018 edition of BottleBats once and for all. We'll organize a _live tournament_ with our 'fancy' new networking support so all you need is your laptop and bot.

Will you take this year's cup (yes there is one) home?
Come and battle, or just watch, it'll be crazy.

See you then
The BottleBats Team

PS: We might throw in some ridiculous matches on the side as well, cause everybody wants to see 8 bots compete on a penis right?
